<h3>Betaverse Test</h3>
<li>
Omnia is a new oppertunity for Communitcation via the Metaverse.<br>
We want to test the Omnia-project in an Save environmet so that we can make out Bugs and general issues before the offical launch.
This Test is called the Betaverse.<br>
The Betaverse describes every Version of Omnia from v0.01, the most recent Version of Omnia, up to v.1.0.<br>
After the Jump to v1.0 Omnia will have all of its final features, but ofcause we will further work on the Project.
